    Definition and Usage
        The accesskey attribute specifies a shortcut key to activate/focus an element.
        The accesskey attribute value must be a single character (a letter or a digit).

    Warning
        Using accesskeys is difficult because they may conflict with other key standards in the browser.
        To avoid this problem, most browsers will use accesskeys only if pressed together with the Alt key.

    Concerns
        Adapting accesskeys to all international languages are difficult.
        The accesskey value may not be present on all keyboards.
        Because of these concerns, it is advised not to use accesskeys.
