      The &lt;br&gt; tag inserts a single line break. The &lt;br&gt; tag is
      useful for writing addresses or poems. The &lt;br&gt; tag is an empty tag
      which means that it has no end tag. Tips and Notes Note: Use the
      &lt;br&gt; tag to enter line breaks, not to add space between paragraphs.
