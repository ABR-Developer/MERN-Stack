    The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML &lt;link&gt; tags, specifically
    when loading external resources such as stylesheets. It is employed as a
    security feature to control how the browser handles requests for
    cross-origin resources. When you include an external stylesheet in your HTML
    document using the &lt;link&gt; tag, the browser might make a cross-origin
    request to fetch that resource. Cross-origin requests are requests for
    resources that are located on a different domain, protocol, or port than the
    one that served the web page. The crossorigin attribute can take two values:
    1) anonymous: This is the default value. It means that the browser will make
    the request without sending any credentials (like cookies or HTTP
    authentication) along with the request. &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
    href="styles.css" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt; 2) use-credentials: This value
    indicates that the browser should include credentials (such as cookies) with
    the request for the cross-origin resource. &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
    href="styles.css" crossorigin="use-credentials"&gt; It's worth noting that
    the crossorigin attribute is not limited to stylesheets; it can also be used
    with other external resources like scripts and fonts that may be loaded from
    a different origin. The use of this attribute helps mitigate potential
    security risks associated with cross-origin requests.
