          <td>

            the target resource for current navigation according to the
            destination given by the "as" attribute (and the priority associated
            with that destination).

          <td>
            Specifies that the browser should pre-render (load) the specified
            webpage in the background. So, if the user navigates to this page,
            it speeds up the page load (because the page is already loaded).
            <strong>Warning!</strong> This wastes the user's bandwidth! Only use
            prerender if you are absolutely sure that the webpage is required at
            some point in the user's journey
