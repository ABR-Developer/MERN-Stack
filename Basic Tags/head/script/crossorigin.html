    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <pre>
        The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
        Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where
        CORS comes in.
        A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes,
        images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
        CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.
        CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows 
        resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own 
        domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine 
        whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to 
        specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.
        Tip: The opposite of cross-origin requests is same-origin requests. This means 
        that a web page can only interact with other documents that are also on the same 
        server. This policy enforces that documents that interact with each other must 
        have the same origin (domain).

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <table class="ws-table-all notranslate">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 20%">Value</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>anonymous<br />use-credentials</td>
          <td>
            Specifies the mode of the CORS request:
            <ul>
              <li>
                anonymous - A cross-origin request is performed. No credentials
                are sent
              </li>
              <li>
                use-credentials - A cross-origin request is performed.
                Credentials are sent (e.g. a cookie, a certificate, a HTTP Basic
                authentication)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Advantages:</h2>
    <pre>
        Enhanced Security:  
            The primary advantage of using the crossorigin attribute is improved security.
            It helps protect against security vulnerabilities related to cross-origin requests
            by allowing the browser to control how it handles requests for external resources.
        Credentials Control:
            With the crossorigin attribute, you have control over whether or not to include 
            credentials (such as cookies) with the cross-origin request. This is crucial when
            accessing resources that require authentication or authorization.
        Prevents Unauthorized Access:
            By defaulting to "anonymous," the attribute prevents the automatic inclusion of 
            credentials, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
        Support for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
            The crossorigin attribute is part of the CORS mechanism, which defines how browsers
            and servers communicate to determine whether or not a web application running at one
            origin can request resources from another origin.

    <h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
    <pre>
        Complexity in Configuration:
            Managing and configuring the crossorigin attribute, especially in conjunction with 
            other security features like the integrity attribute, can add complexity to the 
            development process. It requires careful consideration of the security requirements 
            for each external resource.
        Potential for CORS Issues:
            While CORS is a powerful security feature, it can lead to issues, especially during 
            development when resources may be loaded from different origins. Developers may need
            to configure servers to include the appropriate CORS headers to allow or deny 
            cross-origin requests.
        Browser Compatibility:
            While modern browsers support the crossorigin attribute, older browsers may not fully
            implement or support it. Developers need to be mindful of browser compatibility when 
            using this attribute.
        Overhead in Development:
            Implementing and testing the crossorigin attribute adds some overhead in the development
            process. Developers need to be aware of the security implications and ensure that the 
            attribute is configured correctly for each external resource.
