    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <pre>
        The referrerpolicy attribute specifies which referrer information to send when fetching a script.
    </pre>

    <h2>
      Syntax: &lt;script
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer|no-referrer-when-downgrade|origin|
      origin-when-cross-origin|same-origin|strict-origin-when-cross-origin|unsafe-url"&gt;

          <td>
            The browser omits the Referer header entirely when making requests
            for the resource. This means that the server receiving the request
            won't know the URL of the page that initiated the request.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>no-referrer-when-downgrade</td>
          <td>
            Default. Sends the origin, path, and query string if the protocol
            security level stays the same or is higher (HTTP to HTTP, HTTPS to
            HTTPS, HTTP to HTTPS is ok). Sends nothing to less secure level
            (HTTPS to HTTP is not ok)
          </td>
          <td>
            The Referer header is sent to the target resource if and only if the
            request is secure (HTTPS to HTTP). Otherwise, it behaves like
            no-referrer.

          <td>
            Only sends the origin (scheme, host, and port) of the referring page
            in the Referer header. For example, if the referring page is
            https://example.com/page, only https://example.com will be sent.

            origin, path, and query string for same-origin request
          </td>
          <td>
            Sends the full URL for same-origin requests and only the origin for

            cross-origin request
          </td>
          <td>
            Sends the full URL in the Referer header for same-origin requests,
            but it omits the Referer header for cross-origin requests. This is
            useful for maintaining privacy when navigating within the same
            origin.

            higher (HTTP to HTTP, HTTPS to HTTPS, and HTTP to HTTPS is ok).
            Sends nothing to less secure level (HTTPS to HTTP)
          </td>
          <td>
            Sends the full URL in the Referer header for same-origin requests,
            and for cross-origin requests, it sends only the origin (scheme,
            host, and port) of the referring page.

        <td>no-referrer:</td>

          <li>
            Advantages: Privacy Protection: This policy provides a high level of
            privacy by not sending any Referer information, minimizing the risk
            of disclosing sensitive data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages: Limited Referer Information: While it enhances
            privacy, the absence of Referer information can be a disadvantage in
            scenarios where analytics or logging rely on this information for
            tracking user navigation.

      <li>
        <td>no-referrer-when-downgrade:</td>
        <td>
          <li>
            Advantages: Referrer for Secure Requests: Provides some level of
            privacy for insecure requests while still sending the full Referer
            information for secure (HTTPS) requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages: Potential for Information Disclosure: The Referer
            information is still sent for secure requests, which might be a
            concern in certain security-sensitive scenarios.

        <td>same-origin:</td>
        <td>
          <li>
            Advantages: Privacy within the Same Origin: Maintains privacy by
            sending the full Referer information for same-origin requests while
            omitting it for cross-origin requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages: Limited Cross-Origin Information: Cross-origin
            requests won't include Referer information, which may impact
            analytics and tracking on third-party resources.
          </li>

      <li>
        <td>origin:</td>
        <td>
          <li>
            Advantages: Limited Referer Information: Sends only the origin
            (scheme, host, and port) of the referring page, providing a balance
            between privacy and information disclosure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages: Reduced Analytical Data: Similar to no-referrer, the
            limited information may impact analytics or tracking that relies on
            detailed Referer information.

            Advantages: Balanced Information Disclosure: Sends the full Referer
            information for same-origin requests and only the origin for

            analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disadvantages: Potential for Cross-Origin Information Disclosure:
            While limited, cross-origin requests still include some Referer
            information, which might be a concern in certain scenarios.

            cross-origin requests.

          <li>
            Disadvantages: Potential for Cross-Origin Information Disclosure:
            Similar to strict-origin-when-cross-origin, cross-origin requests
            still include some Referer information.

          <li>
            Disadvantages: Privacy Concerns: Provides the least privacy among
