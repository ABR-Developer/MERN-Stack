    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <pre>
        The integrity attribute allows a browser to check the fetched script to ensure
        that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated.
        Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a W3C specification that allows web developers 
        to ensure that resources hosted on third-party servers have not been altered.
        Use of SRI is recommended!
        When using SRI, the webpage holds the hash and the server holds the file (the 
        .js file in this case). The browser downloads the file, then checks it, to make
        sure that it is a match with the hash in the integrity attribute. If it matches,
        the file is used, and if not, the file is blocked.
        You can use an online SRI hash generator to generate integrity hashes: SRI Hash Generator
