    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <pre>
        The &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only,
        and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
        The &lt;title&gt; tag is required in HTML documents!
        The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)!
        The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages
        in search results.

    <h2>The &lt;title&gt; element:</h2>
    <pre>
        defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search-engine results
        Here are some tips for creating good titles:
        
        Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)
        Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that
        Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)
        So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
        
        Note: You can NOT have more than one &lt;title&gt; element in an HTML document.
