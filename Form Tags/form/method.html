    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The method attribute specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is
      sent to the page specified in the action attribute). The form-data can be
      sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction
      (with method="post").
    </p>

    <h3>Notes on GET:</h3>
    <p>
      Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs The length of a URL is
      limited (about 3000 characters) Never use GET to send sensitive data!
      (will be visible in the URL) Useful for form submissions where a user
      wants to bookmark the result GET is better for non-secure data, like query
      strings in Google
    </p>

    <h3>Notes on POST:</h3>
    <p>
      Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown
      in URL) Has no size limitations Form submissions with POST cannot be
      bookmarked
