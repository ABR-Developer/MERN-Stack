    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies
      that an input field is read-only. A read-only input field cannot be
      modified (however, a user can tab to it, highlight it, and copy the text
      from it). The readonly attribute can be set to keep a user from changing
      the value until some other conditions have been met (like selecting a
      checkbox, etc.). Then, a JavaScript can remove the readonly value, and
      make the input field editable. Note: A form will still submit an input
      field that is readonly, but will not submit an input field that is
      disabled!
