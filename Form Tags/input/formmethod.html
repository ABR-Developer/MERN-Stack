    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The formmethod attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to
      the action URL. The formmethod attribute overrides the method attribute of
      the &lt;form&gt; element. Note: The formmethod attribute can be used with
      type="submit" and type="image". The form-data can be sent as URL variables
      (method="get") or as an HTTP post transaction (method="post"). Notes on
      the "get" method: This method appends the form-data to the URL in
      name/value pairs This method is useful for form submissions where a user
      want to bookmark the result There is a limit to how much data you can
      place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure
      that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred Never use the
      "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive
      information will be visible in the browser's address bar) Notes on the
      "post" method: This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
      Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked The "post"
      method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size
      limitations
