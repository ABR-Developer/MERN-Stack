    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The disabled attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies
      that the button should be disabled. A disabled button is unusable and
      un-clickable. The disabled attribute can be set to keep a user from
      clicking on the button until some other condition has been met (like
      selecting a checkbox, etc.). Then, a JavaScript could remove the disabled
      value, and make the button clickable again.
