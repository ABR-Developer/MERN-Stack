    <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
      Choose your favorite subject:
      <button name="subject" type="submit" value="HTML">HTML</button>
      <button name="subject" type="submit" value="CSS">CSS</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The name attribute specifies the name for a &lt;button&gt; element. The
      name attribute is used to reference form-data after the form has been
      submitted, or to reference the element in a JavaScript. Tip: Several
      &lt;button&gt; elements can share the same name. This allows you to have
      several buttons with equal names, which can submit different values when
      used in a form.
