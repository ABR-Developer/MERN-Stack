    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The formmethod attribute specifies which HTTP method to use when sending
      the form-data. This attribute overrides the form's method attribute. The
      formmethod attribute is only used for buttons with type="submit". The
      form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post
      (with method="post").
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes on the "get" method: it appends the form-data to the URL in
      name/value pairs it is useful for form submissions where a user want to
      bookmark the result There is a limit to how much data you can place in a
      URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of
      the form-data will be correctly transferred Never use the "get" method to
      pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will
      be visible in the browser's address bar)
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes on the "post" method: it sends the form-data as an HTTP post
      transaction Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
      it is more robust and secure than "get" it does not have size limitations
