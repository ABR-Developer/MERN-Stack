    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The disabled attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies
      that the text area should be disabled. A disabled text area is unusable
      and the text is not selectable (cannot be copied). The disabled attribute
      can be set to keep a user from using the text area until some other
      condition has been met (like selecting a checkbox, etc.). Then, a
      JavaScript could remove the disabled value, and make the text area usable.
