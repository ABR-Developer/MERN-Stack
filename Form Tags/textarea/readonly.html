    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies
      that a text area should be read-only. In a read-only text area, the
      content cannot be changed, but a user can tab to it, highlight it and copy
      content from it. The readonly attribute can be set to keep a user from
      using a text area until some other condition has been met (like selecting
      a checkbox, etc.). Then, a JavaScript is required to remove the readonly
      value, and make the text area editable.
